# Introduction

The name of my project is a clothing store. As my first project I wanted to do something more attractive, something we all have experience with. So I created a clothing store where clothes can be purchased at. To accomplish this I combine what I have learned from Html, CSS and Javascript together.


# Description

This project is about creating a clothing store where people can buy clothes from. The app has images of variety of men, women and children cloths. It also has the name of the cloth, the description, the price, two icons and a number in between the icons . The first icon is the minus icon, colored in red. When this icon is click the number in between which represent the number of item purchase will decrease. The second icon is the plus icon. This increase the number of item when click. On top there is a navbar, on the far right is a icon of a cart and a number. The number increase or decrease depending on which icon you click. When the mouse enter the cart icon, an alert popup will display the amount of item you have in the cart. Any time you hover the mouse over the shopping item the size enlarge shows you which item you've selected.
